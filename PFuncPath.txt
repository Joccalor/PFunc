custom_path=0
# If PFunc is having trouble finding R or R_HOME, then you need to find
# the correct directory where R is installed on your computer. Once you do,
# paste the full directory path after the equals sign above.

# Windows users should use two backslashes between steps in the path, like:
# custom_path=C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-3.3.1

# Mac users and Linux users should use single forward slashes, like:
# custom_path=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources
# or
# custom_path=/usr/bin/

# Restore to default by setting custom_path=0
